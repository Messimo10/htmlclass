<!--

HTML -Hypertext markup language - is made up of elements.

-A HTML element has an opening tag and a closing tag. <opening> </closing>
-Within an element we can have text content or other elements (children)
-Some elements however are self closing for example <meta> tags.

-The opening tag for different elements can have attributes (key=value pairs) that provide
additional information or add functionality to a html element e.g. lang="en" implies that the element's content is in enlish.
